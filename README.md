# Rock and Talk to podcast bridge

This is a simple bridge between Virgin Radio's website and a RSS feed to allow you to automatically retrieve the mp3 of "[Rock and Talk](https://www.virginradio.it/sezioni/1154/rock-talk)", a daily program of [Virgin Radio Italy](https://www.virginradio.it/).

# Why
Unfortunately, the website provides the links to download the episodes but no easy way to download them or to play with a good UI..

With this simple Python application, which can be deployed for free on Heroku or similar services, you can build your own podcast with the content of the show. Just add the url `BASEURL/feed.rss` to your favorite podcast application and enjoy it.
